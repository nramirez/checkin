# checkin
Simple app to manage a community check-ins


### Issue
In my community we have multiple recurring events, some of them happening at the same time.
Right now is complicated to know who's in an specific event.

### Solution
- Web app to have the list of possible users + the list of events.
- Allow users to checkin using a QR code (we'll have QR readers at the events)
- Checkin through the website
- Checkin using a mobile app


### Tech
- ReactJS, NextJS, GraphQL, Hasura
- Design: Material UI
